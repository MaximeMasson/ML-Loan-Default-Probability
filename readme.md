This report examines the modeling process for predictive analysis, focusing on Gradient Boosting. Through targeted feature engineering, significant improvements in performance metrics were achieved, establishing Gradient Boosting as the top-performing algorithm.

Further refinement through feature selection enhanced accuracy, resulting in a final **AUC score of 0.96**, highlighting the importance of identifying and retaining key features. However, the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) posed challenges by inadvertently reducing model performance through the elimination of essential predictive information.

This report highlights the iterative journey of optimizing model performance through strategic feature engineering and selection.
